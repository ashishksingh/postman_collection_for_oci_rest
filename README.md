Download the repository's Postman collections and environment.

Import the environment into Postman using the ‘Import’ button at the top, and activate it by selecting it from the top right drop-down. 

Open and Edit the newly imported environment, and set the OCI REST variables tenancyId, authUserId, keyFingerprint and private Key.

Now import the two collections into Postman.

From the OCI_REST_INITIALIZATION collection, invoke the Initializer GET for ‘jsrsasign-all-min.js’ , which imports and initializes a required library jsrsasign for encryption and digital signatures. This is a one-time setup task.

REMEMBER to change the environment (on the top right) from "No Environment" to "OCI_Environment".

That’s it!! Now you can use the other oci_rest_collection to invoke any OCI REST APIs. The collection provides a sample GET and POST request, which can be extrapolated to invoke any OCI REST API.

Just make sure that the OCI REST calls are executed as part of the OCI_REST_COLLECTION, as that collection contains the necessary javascript code to generate OCI’s authentication header
